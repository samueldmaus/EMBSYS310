## Why use twoâ€™s complement to represent negative numbers?

### Two's complement is used to represent negative numbers because it allows for addition and subtraction to be done in the same way they would be for unsigned numbers. Also, in two's complement zero only has one single representation - compared to one's complement where there is a negative zero.
