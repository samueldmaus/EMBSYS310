## Using the telegraph example, and the challenges listed in the module as reference, and describe another device that you would like to discuss. Describe how you think its embedded system works, and what design challenges itpresents.

### I think a popular and widely used example of another embedded device would be a digital camera. The way it would work is when the shutter is pressed, the image is captured and converted to a different form. Then it's saved to the internal memory using that format to conserve space. Once the camera is connected to a computer, the file must be rebuilt back into a different format (jpeg, png, etc). There's also other software that is normally available on the camera in order to apply filters to images. The most obvious challenge is space -- being able to store a lot of images, which are normally big files, on a small device. A second design challenge would be timing. Normally the images come with some information to tell the user when they taken, therefor maintaining a clock system is important as well.
